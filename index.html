            <p class="information">The ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems 2023 (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2023),
                the thirty-first edition, will be held in Hamburg, Germany, November 13-16, 2023. Traditionally, all workshops will be held on November 13, 2023
                at the main conference venue. The former workshops, known as EM-GIS, had been held several times, starting in 2015 and continuing until 2021.
                EM-GIS 2023 aims to continue this practice and invites submission of papers.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p class="information">Safety refers to the stable external environment and orders wherein society and citizens need to engage in and conduct normal life,
                work, study, entertainment, and communication. Resilience in public safety refers to the ability to withstand the shocks and pressures of emergencies on society,
                economy, technology systems and infrastructure, and to maintain the basic structure and functions of an emergency event. The Resilience theory is dedicated to
                enhancing disaster resistance and recovery capabilities as well as improving emergency response capabilities. So that systems, communities,
                or societies exposed to hazards can resist and absorb them by protecting and restoring important basic structures and functions effectively in time.</p>
            <p class="information">Emergency management serves as an important aspect of Safety and resilience, involving four stages: Planning and Mitigation,
                Preparedness, Response and Recovery. Geospatial applications (including GIS) have been extensively used in each stage of emergency management.
                Decision-makers can utilize the geospatial information to develop planning and mitigation strategies.
                GIS models and simulation capabilities are used to exercise response and recovery plans during non-disaster times.
                They help the decision-makers understand near real-time possibilities during an event. Once a disaster occurs,
                GIS will take effect in real-time response and recovery activities. For example, while global communities are trying to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic,
                GIS tools are widely used by health departments, safety and emergency management authorities and wider professionals around the world for gathering and
                analyzing data to support informed decisions, greatly enhancing safety and resilience in an anthropogenic incident or a natural disaster.</p>
            <p class="information">GIS provides reliable support for spatial analysis and decision-making in safety and resilience.
                However, the incorporation of spatial dimension or spatio-temporal dimension adds to the difficulties of the analysis.
                How to integrate data and models with spatial structures, such as integrating the GIS data layers and dangerous chemical diffusion data,
                appears as a big issue faced by safety and resilience work. Furthermore, safety and resilience require abilities to make quick responses to real-time situations.
                To meet the requirement, it is challenging and promising to apply lots of new geospatial technologies to support the quick response and recovery and
                the integration of location-based wireless information streams. With the advances in GIS technologies, the improvement of safety and resilience research becomes possible.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>PURPOSE</h3>
            <p class="information">The purpose is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and
                progress in related areas and bring together researchers and practitioners in massive spatio-temporal data management,
                spatial database, spatial data analysis, spatial data visualization, data integration, model integration,
                cloud computing, parallel algorithms, internet of things, complex event detection, optimization theory,
                intelligent transportation systems and social networks to support better public policy through disaster detection, response and rescue.</p>
